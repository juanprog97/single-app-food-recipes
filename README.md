![plot](/public/logo.png)

It is a simple application that allows the user to log in to a simple food recipe search functionality, where you can see details of the recipes (name, instructions, nutritional value, etc.) and also select and save your favorite recipe, in where it remains to be saved even when you log out and log in again with the same email. The application also has a mini option to draw a figure by placing the points and this at the end joins them.
